<p>To be completley honest i havent really done anything productive in quarantine. Mostly i have been playing games on my computer like before. It is nice to be able to do anything, but i think i would just like do what i like to do everyday. While i COULD be doing something more productive, but i think i would just rather do what i WANT to do. I have also found a job at Wendy's so i have been working and listening to music(which is by far my favorite past time ever). Lastly i have been able to think about what i had lost during quarantine and showed me what i need to be thankful of in my life, most importantly, my life in general. So in a way, i hate quarantine, but i also can be somewhat thankful for it opening my eyes. Not saying that im glad its here, but it has done that for me.
